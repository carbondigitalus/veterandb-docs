# Accepted Documents

We originally only accepted the DD214, but have since aligned our standards with [ID.me](https://id.me). Since we will eventually move to their verification platform, this makes sense for us.

NOTE:
ALL OF THESE METHODS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED FOR THE USA MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS.

## Verify with a .mil email address

You can verify your active duty status with your `.mil` email address, instead of uploading a document. If your official email address has `ctr` or `civ` in the email address, you will have to upload your documents.

### How to Verify with Email

1. Submit our Veteran Verification Form, found in the [CMS portal](https://app.veterandb.com/login).

- Use your VeteranDB account email in this form

2. From your `.mil` email, send an email to [support@veterandb.com](mailto:support@veterandb.com), and provide us your VeteranDB account email.

We will use both of these together to verify your account.

## Acceptable documents

The document you upload depends on your military status.

### Service Members

- Military pay stubs - Leave & Earnings Statement (LES)
- Record briefs - ARB/ERB/ORB (US Army)
- Reserve Activation Orders
- Enlistment contracts

### Veterans

- DD214 form
- Driver’s License or DMV-Issued State ID with VETERAN endorsement
- Honorable Discharge Certificate
- NGB form 22
- Reserve Separation Orders
- Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC), or Veteran Identification Card (VIC)

### Retirees

- DD214 form (must show 20 years of service or the reason for discharge was retirement)
- NGB form 22 (must show 20 years of service or the reason for discharge was retirement)
- Retiree Account Statement (eRAS)
- VA disability letter

Note: To request a copy of your DD214, visit the [National Archives site](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records).

### Family members and surviving spouses

- Military spouses and family members can upload any of the military documents listed in the categories above. Surviving Spouses can also submit a Casualty Report (DD Form 1300).
- Proof of relationship with servicemember, i.e. marriage certificate or birth certificate, etc.

Note: If your documents weren’t accepted, check the section below on troubleshooting.

## Unacceptable documents

The following documents are not accepted:

- Uniformed Services ID cards
- CAC cards

## Rejected Documents

Documents can get rejected for a variety of reasons. Below are some of the common reasons why your document may have been rejected and suggestions on what to do next.

1. You uploaded a document that is not an acceptable document type

- If verifying in Self-Service, we accept driver’s licenses, state IDs, passports, and passport cards.
- Find a list of acceptable primary and secondary identification documents for video call verification.

2. Your document is missing the required information to verify your identity

- Make sure your document includes the required information. For example, it may need to include your name, last four of your Social Security number, expiration date, etc. Learn more about primary and secondary identification document requirements.

3. There was a mismatch between the document type you selected and the document type you uploaded.

- During verification, you are prompted to select the type of document you will upload. Ensure the type you select matches the document you upload.

4. You uploaded expired document(s)

- In most cases, your document must be unexpired. In some cases, you can use an expired Driver’s license or State ID.

5. Your uploaded document did not match the name or address you provided.

- Your documents may be valid, but you may need to edit your submitted information (such as name or address) to match the information on your documents. Otherwise, you can change to a different document type that matches the information you entered.
- If your document information contains typos, especially your name or address, you may need to request a new document from the organization or agency you got the document from, or choose a different document to verify.

6. The document you uploaded was unreadable

- Only upload documents that are in good condition, where the text and your photo, if applicable, is clearly readable. For example, a blurry document will usually be rejected.
