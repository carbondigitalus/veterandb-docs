# Manual Process

We have every intention of growing to a point where we can begin using [ID.me](https://id.me) to handle this automatically, but the cost is large. Especially a large bill to swallow for our free platform. Until then, we will have to verify your Veteran status manually.

## Access Verify Page

When you login to our [CMS portal](https://app.veterandb.com/login), you will find the verification details under your account. This will give you a direct link to our form and file upload area.

## Verification Form

The Veteran Verification form is a Microsoft Form, and all of the data is sent into a Microsoft SharePoint list. This list contains just your Name, Email, and approval status. We use this as a tracking mechanism so we have a log of who has been verified. We could put this directly into the actual database, but it does not seem necessary with a manual process.

## Uploaded Documents

From the Veteran Verification form, you will find a file upload link. When you click on this link, you are taken to a SharePoint/OneDrive upload area. Uploading a document here, will directly upload it to our SharePoint/OneDrive with no middle layers. Meaning that no third-party can intercept the documents.

## Document Retention

Immediately after verifying your Veteran status, we will update your SharePoint list record, and delete your documents. This will send them to a Recycle Bin, so we will delete them a second time. Your documents are not retained any longer than need be to verify your status and delete them. In most cases, we will verify your documents the same day that you send them.

## Document Access

For security, there is only one person who has access to SharePoint, and that is our Founder, Mr. Ledbetter. He is the only person who has access to manually verify everyone.
