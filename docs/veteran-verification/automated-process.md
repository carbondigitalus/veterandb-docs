# Automated Process

In due time, we will grow to a point where we can begin using [ID.me](https://id.me) to handle verification automatically.

## Projected Cost

We have met multiple times with the ID.me team, and they have projected the cost to start at $15k annually. Since ID.me is an enterprise solution, this large cost is to be expected.

## Veteran Dependents

Once we have an automated process up and running, we will begin allowing dependents onto the platform.

## Final Thoughts

We are working diligently to try and find a way to leverage ID.me for many reasons. The most critical is that we DO NOT want to handle your documents.
